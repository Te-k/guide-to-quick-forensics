# Methodology

The methodology to do triaging can be quite ad-hoc.
When it comes to legal litigation, for example against the attacker or a company who provided aid to the attacker, there are certain forensic procedures that should normally be respected.
If you think there are elements in the case you are working on that might lead to a legal investigation, you should consult with local advisors and perhaps seek instead the assistance of an accredited forensics firm.
