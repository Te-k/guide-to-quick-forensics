to Quick Forensics\nOften times, members of civil society have the more or less justified suspicion of being surveilled. Perhaps they experienced anomalies with their computers or mobile devices, or they have reasons to believe that some of their communications have been intercepted.\nTechnologists and first responders working in civil society are often requested assistance with the inspection of human rights defenders' devices.\nThe purpose of this guide is to provide an introduction to a methodology that could be useful for the quick assessment of potential infections. \nWhile the methodology introduced here by no means is sufficient to provide a definitive and conclusive assessment over the cleanliness of a suspected device, it can help at least to identify the more obvious infections. Ultimately, it is up to your intuition and understanding of the context to determine what are the best recommendations to give. Hopefully this guide will help you getting started doing Quick Forensics, and will provide you the tools and techniques to start practicing and developing your skills.\nNote: this guide is currently under development. You can contribute to this text here.\nWhy do Quick Forensics?\nLearning to perform quick forensics helps determine whether additional resources might be required or not. \nLearning to triage helps determine whether the case requires additional resources or not.\nBeing able to extract relevant data means that in-depth investigators will not need access to the device (at least, not immediately).\nMore people doing triaging, means better scalability of incident response in civil society.\nResearchers working on targeted threats against civil society are few, and mostly focused on publications.\nThe objectives\nWhen performing quick forensics and responding to a potential compromise, we have the following broad objectives:\n\nTry to determine if the device is indeed potentially infected.\nExtract sufficient data for subsequent verification and that could be useful for further investigation (for example, to determine what type of malware infected the device).\nDetermine what to do with the device and how to further assist its owner.\n\n"},"preparations.html":{"url":"preparations.html","title":"Preparations","keywords":"","body":"Preparations\nThere are many ways to inspect a device and acquire data. There are some initial considerations to make before proceeding. Some of these could be:\nSafety: Is it safe for the owner to proceed? What if we get it wrong? Is the owner at significant risk?\nBackup: Is there a possibility that the triaging would cause loss of data? Are there backups?\nMethodology: Do we think there are opportunities for litigation? If so, is the way we acquire data going to hinder them?\n"},"safety.html":{"url":"safety.html","title":"Safety","keywords":"","body":"Safety\nSafety of the owner of the device is paramount.\nBefore even beginning the engagement, it is important we considered possible negative consequences for the device owner's safety. Firstly, we need to properly assess the risk the owner of the device is currently exposed to. Secondly, we need to determine whether the assistance we are going to provide could cause further exposure. Despite the best intentions, and the owner's likely desire to be reassured and feel comfortable using their devices free of spyware, the activities we are about to perform could, for example, cause retaliation or expedite a response on the attacker's part. We need to be prepared for such eventuality: in some cases, it might be even more prudent to not continue with the engagement at all if it would be too risky.\nIn order to help you estimate the level of risk faced by the owner of the device, and to prepare an appropriate action plan, following are some important questions you should try to answer in advance:\n\nIs it safe for the owner to bring the device to you? If the device is monitored, would any location tracking further jeopardize the owner?\nIf you find an infection, you almost always would not want to let the owner continue using the device. Do you have a plan for replacement? Attackers might notice that the victim has suddenly disappeared.\nIf the device is replaced, would the attacker losing access to the victim cause further retaliation?\nIs the owner in immediate danger? If we wrongly determine that the device is clean, how could this negatively affect the owner?\n\nAnswering these questions will hopefully help you decide if and how to proceed with the quick forensics of the devices.\nShould the device connect online?\nIf you decide to proceed with the inspection, you most likely also want to plan to have the device to be completely disconnected from any WiFi or mobile Internet connection.\nIn the case of a laptop, ideally you should ask the owner to disable the WiFi before turning it off and bringing the device to you. Either way, make sure no connection is available before starting. In the case of a mobile phone, you might want to ask the owner to turn the device off and remove the SIM card before bringing it to you.\nKeep your tools on an external USB drive. Limit transfer of files, and clean leftovers once you are done.\nBear in mind, even with all these precautions, if the triaging is mistakenly concluded with nothing found and the owner resumes using it, it is still quite likely the attacker will notice. A trojan might take screenshots of the desktop while you are operating, or even record the audio from the microphone. In case something is found, you do not want to let it send such data to the attacker.\n"},"trust.html":{"url":"trust.html","title":"Trust","keywords":"","body":"A note on Trust\nWhen asking you to check it, the owner of the device is trusting you with likely the most intimate possession they have. Be mindful of that.\nFor example, when checking phones it might be inevitable to have to go through SMS and WhatsApp messages to find potential malicious ones. When checking through computers, you might come across documents and personal pictures. In some cases, going through such data stored on their devices might resurrect traumatic experiences. Be mindful of that too.\nIn some cases you might need the owner of the device to enter their password, such as for example when checking Mac computers, or entering the PIN code to unlock their phone. Obviously, avoid watching over as passwords are being entered.\nMake sure you comfort the owner, explain them exactly what you are going to do, ask for their consent, and offer to interrupt at any time.\n"},"backup.html":{"url":"backup.html","title":"Backup","keywords":"","body":"Backup\nAlthough under normal circumstances it shouldn't happen, there's always the eventuality that some tools, while performing some aggressive checks, particularly on older or cluttered systems, might cause some instability and crashes. You should be prepared for this eventuality. It might also be the case that if you find the device to be infected, you might want to safekeep it and the owner will want to recover some data.\nIt is advisable that before proceeding with the inspection you make sure the owner is aware of any risk of data loss, and that all steps have been taken to preserve at the very least the most critical files. Of course, a full and secure backup of the system is a much more preferable option, but circumstances and time do not always allow for that.\nAlong with a USB drive with the collection of tools you might need for the inspection, you should consider always carrying an extra drive with you (perhaps with VeraCrypt or any other file encryption utility you prefer) to be used in case you need to preserve some files from the device.\n"},"methodology.html":{"url":"methodology.html","title":"Methodology","keywords":"","body":"Methodology\nThe methodology for doing quick forensics can be quite ad-hoc, and eventually with time you will develop your own. This guide should help in this process. Generally, when trying to triage a possible infection, you will like for any anomaly that you are able to identify on the device. Such anomalies, for example, can be:\n\nApplications and processes running on the device that you and the owner of the device do not recognize. Applications and processes that show some unusual characteristics, such as suspicious names and file locations, or attempts at hiding.\nBecause spyware normally would want to be able to survive a shutdown of the device, you will look for applications which maintain persistence over the device and are therefore registered for automatic execution at startup.\nSuspicious network connections to infrastructure and services that you and the owner of the device do not recognize.\n\nWhile it is not possible to compile an exhaustive checklist of precise anomalies to look out for, the process of developing a robust quick forensics methodology will require training your eye, by inspecting as many devices you can get your hands. Eventually, you will start recognizing patterns across various operating systems, and become more rapid and efficient at discarding legitimate applications and spotting those that stand out. It takes practice.\nConsiderations on legal litigation\nUnder some circumstances, it is possible that the owner of the device has an interest in pursuing some legal action against the perpetrators of the attack you are documenting, or perhaps the producers of the technology used to conduct it. This could be the case, for example, with victims of domestic abuse, or perhaps with activists seeking to prove some illegal surveillance of their communications.\nIf you believe the person you are assisting might be interested in any form of legal litigation, especially based on your work, you might need to adapt your methodology. From country to country, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, rules and best practices for gathering digital evidence admissible in court can vary. Generally, because of chain of custody and to safeguard the integrity of the device, data acquisition (especially from phones) might be heavily restricted.\nYou should inform yourself about the laws and the standard practices from the jurisdiction you normally operate in. Ideally, you should seek advise from local forensics specialists and maybe even seek the assistance of an accredited forensics firm.\n"},"windows.html":{"url":"windows.html","title":"Checking Windows Computers","keywords":"","body":"Checking Windows Computers\nIn this section we will go through some of the basic steps to take when checking a suspected Windows computer.\n"},"windows/autoruns.html":{"url":"windows/autoruns.html","title":"Review Programs Launching at Startup","keywords":"","body":"Review Programs Launching at Startup\nMalware need to find a way to run on start-up when a computer is rebooted, it is thus one of the first thing to check when looking for malicious programs. Windows systems have different ways to have programs running on startup, and malwware often use tricks to appears legitimate and/or avoiding standard autoruns methods.\nThe Sysinternals Autoruns tool allows to list exhaustively the programs running on start-up (you should run this program as Administrator if possible) :\n\nAutoruns embedds a feature to check for binary files on VirusTotal, it is a very good way to do a first check on suspicious files (check the \"About Virus Total\" part after for more information). To enable check on VirusTotal, go in Options > Scan Options and enable \"Check VirusTotal.com\" (be careful of not enabling \"Submit Unknown Files\") :\n\nThen Autoruns will take a bit of time to check for all the files on startup and add results under the form X/X where the first X is the number of antiviruses detecting this file as malicious and the second X is the total number of antiviruses checked.\n\nUse this analysis to look more closely to :\n\nAny file detected as Malicious by at least one antivirus\nAny file unknown by VirusTotal\n\nThen look for suspicious entries manually in tabs Logon, Scheduled Tasks, Services.\nFor each of these entries, you should look for :\n\nThe name of the entry : a random string would be suspicious, or any common name with typo (crhome)\nThe description : most legitimate programs have a description\nThe path : any program installed in C:\\Users is suspicious (often in C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData), C:\\Temp is clearly abnormal, most of the programs should be in C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86)\n\nCommon tricks :\n\nMany malware will use the Windows program rundll32.exe to load the actual malicious file (often a dll file but that can be named otherwise). As rundll32 will be checked on VirusTotal it will avoid the detection\n\nExample of suspicious entries :\n\nThe KeyBoy malware creates a Registry Key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\shell with the value explorer.exe,C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\cfs.dal\" cfsUpdate\n\nAbout VirusTotal\nVirusTotal (often called VT) is originally a Spanish company acquired by Google in 2012. Its business model is to provide checking of files by many anviruses for free to everyone, and sell access to this data to security companies. So keep in mind that files uploaded to VirusTotal are not kept confidential.\nThere are two ways to check for a file in VirusTotal :\n\nCheck if the fingerprint is known by VirusTotal : this is what is done by default by Sysinternals tools, it means that the file itself is not sent to VirusTotal, but it only check if the file is already known by VT. All Windows system files should be known, an unknown file on startup is definitely suspicious\nUpload the file to VirusTotal : in that case the file is sent ot VirusTotal which analyze it using multiple antiviruses. Keep in mind that VirusTotal will share this file with its customers, so do not upload any sensitive information.\n\nRegarding results :\n\nA file having more than 5 antiviruses detecting it as malicious definitely indicate a malware. You can check for the name of the malware given by antiviruses or comment to have an idea of what kind of malware it can be.\nA file with less then 5 antiviruses can be either a malicious file detected y few antiviruses, or a legitimate file with false positive detection\nA file known by VT without any\n\n"},"windows/processes.html":{"url":"windows/processes.html","title":"Review Running Processes","keywords":"","body":"Review Running Processes\nProcess Explorer from sysinternals list all the processes running on the system hierarchically :\n\nProcess Explorer should directly check the file hashes on VirusTotal, it is a good first step to identify suspicious processes.
